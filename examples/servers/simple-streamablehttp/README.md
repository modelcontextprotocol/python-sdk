# MCP Simple StreamableHttp Server Example

A simple MCP server example demonstrating the StreamableHttp transport, which enables HTTP-based communication with MCP servers using streaming.

## Features

- Uses the StreamableHTTP transport for server-client communication
- Supports REST API operations (POST, GET, DELETE) for `/mcp` endpoint
- Task management with anyio task groups
- Ability to send multiple notifications over time to the client
- Proper resource cleanup and lifespan management

## Usage

Start the server on the default or custom port:

```bash

# Using custom port
uv run mcp-simple-streamablehttp --port 3000

# Custom logging level
uv run mcp-simple-streamablehttp --log-level DEBUG

# Enable JSON responses instead of SSE streams
uv run mcp-simple-streamablehttp --json-response
```

The server exposes a tool named "start-notification-stream" that accepts three arguments:

- `interval`: Time between notifications in seconds (e.g., 1.0)
- `count`: Number of notifications to send (e.g., 5)
- `caller`: Identifier string for the caller

## Client

You can connect to this server using an HTTP client, for now only Typescript SDK has streamable HTTP client examples or you can use (Inspector)[https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector]
