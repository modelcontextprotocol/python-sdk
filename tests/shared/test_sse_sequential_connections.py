    """Test that multiple sequential SSE client connections work correctly.

    This test validates the fix for a critical bug where manual cancel_scope.cancel()
    in mcp/client/sse.py violated anyio task lifecycle requirements, causing:
        RuntimeError: Attempted to exit cancel scope in a different task than it was entered in

    Environment-Dependent Behavior:
    --------------------------------
    This bug is environment-dependent and only manifests in production environments
    with concurrent request handling overhead (e.g., GCP Agent Engine, FastAPI under
    load). In these environments:
        - First connection: succeeds (same task context)
        - Subsequent connections: fail with RuntimeError (different task context)
        - Failure rate: 75% in production

    Local Testing Limitation:
    --------------------------
    Simple sequential execution maintains consistent task context, so the bug
    remains dormant in this test. Both buggy and fixed code pass locally.

    Test Strategy:
    --------------
    This test documents expected behavior (sequential connections should work)
    and provides regression protection against reintroducing the manual cancel.
    Production validation required to confirm the fix in concurrent environments.
